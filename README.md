 # flutter_chamber

[Work in progress] ✍️

Intended to make Flutter iOS builds more stable and easier to reproduce.

Inspired by chamber script by Fedor Korotkov https://fedor.medium.com/reproducible-and-contained-ci-builds-on-mac-os-without-virtualization-a17f83171396

Originally tuned for internal use, but who knows. Perhaps it could be useful for someone else.
Feel free to fork and customize for your needs. Or suggest improvements 🙌
